# Multiplication-Table
### Description
This is a plugin I made for Google spreadsheets. I am unable to post this as a plugin as it costs $5 and I don't have that kind of money. Instead, I'm posting it here with instructions on how to use it.

### Instructions
1. Open a Google spreadsheet (You can name this spreadsheet whatever you want)
2. Click Tools > Script Editor
3. Name the app: Multiplication Table
4. Go to the page that is opened
5. Replace the content of the code.gs file in the editor with the content of the code.gs file in this repository
6. Go to File > New > HTML file
7. Name the file: NumberTable
8. Replace the content of the NumberTable.html file in the editor with the content of the NumberTable.html file in this repository
9. Go to File > Save all
10. Go back to your Spreadsheet tab and refresh
11. Go to Add-ons > Multiplication Table > Start
12. Go into the sidebar that has appeared and input the dimensions of your desired table
13. Click "Start"
14. Watch the magic happen
